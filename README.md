# Thoughts - 03/10/2024

Not going to lie, I spent way too many hours on this. More so than I'd like to admit.
Most of the time, I was completely lost and had no idea how or what to do.
Spent a lot of time Googling, Copiloting and Trial and Erroring my way through this.
Copilot was especially useful in getting down the right syntax, showing code that I wouldn't have never thought of on my own, and directing me forward when I was stuck.

Also special thanks to `Fashoomp` and `Circular Import Sucks` from the Python Discord for reviewing my code and giving feedback.

**Next Steps:** 

1. Thinking of creating another text-based OOP game similar to this for more practice OOP
2. Move on to the next exercise: Building a Web Scraper
